To create the circos plot we first divided our data by years and then we created all the unique pair combinations happening within each country, for example, if country "A" had the shocks "1", "2", and "3" in year 1991, then we create the pair combination "1-2", "2-3" and "1-3", meanin that those shock happened concurrently. If then country "B" had shocks "1","2", and "4", we add an additional count to the alredye created pair "1-2" and create the new pair "1-4" and "2-4". We do that for all countries, year by year, ntil we obtain pair combinations and how many times they happen coocrrently. The circos plot shows the link between those pairs and the width of the lines represent how many times we foundthe coocurrence across time and countries
